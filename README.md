Introducing my latest project: a cutting-edge 5-band equalizer designed to elevate your audio experience to new heights. This innovative creation boasts five precision-tuned bands, strategically positioned at 50Hz, 250Hz, 800Hz, 3300Hz, and 16000Hz, allowing you to fine-tune your audio like never before.

But that's not all. We've prioritized user-friendliness by incorporating LED indicators, providing at-a-glance feedback on your selected settings. To further enhance the user experience, we've integrated the LM3915 visual feedback system, ensuring that you have complete control over your sound, down to the last detail.

To guarantee top-notch audio quality, we've equipped this equalizer with the NE5532 amplifier and a reliable L7912/L7812 power supply. This combination ensures that your audio signals are processed with the utmost precision and clarity, resulting in an auditory experience that's nothing short of exceptional.

This project has been a journey of discovery and innovation, deepening my expertise in circuit design and user-focused engineering. And now, I'm excited to share it with you on GitHub, where you can explore the code, schematics, and documentation, and even contribute to its development. Together, let's take your audio experience to the next level! Explore the project on GitHub and join us on this sonic adventure.
